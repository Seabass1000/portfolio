title: "Geospatial Analysis of Population Distribution and Density in Senegal"
---
I used advanced geospatial mapping techniques to analyze Senegal's demographic distribution and geographic features. Utilizing geospatial mapping and geometric bar plots, I highlighted the population density variations across Senegal's regions, with a focus on the highly populated Dakar and Thies regions. Through detailed 3D models and geometric bar plots, I visualized how population is distributed across urban and rural areas. Focusing on the least populated Kedougou region, the analysis includes defacto human settlements and examines critical infrastructure such as transportation networks and healthcare facilities. This project underscored the contrasts in infrastructure access and population between urban and rural areas, providing insights into population distribution, settlement patterns, and accessibility challenges in one of West Africa's key developing countries.
