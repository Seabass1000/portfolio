I developed a multiple linear regression model to project life expectancy in 193 countries using socioeconomic and public health indicators from 2000 to 2015. By using data from the Global Health Observatory and the United Nations, I identified key determinants such as adult mortality rates and infant deaths due to HIV/AIDS. The final model, refined through forward stepwise regression, achieved a high adjusted R-squared value of 0.8803, demonstrating its robustness. This model underscores the importance of effective healthcare spending by governments and humanitarian organizations. The insights derived can aid in optimizing resource allocation to improve global health outcomes.
