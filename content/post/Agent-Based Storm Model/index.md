I developed an agent-based model to analyze the impacts of FEMA's new Risk Rating 2.0 pricing methodology on flood insurance premiums in Florida. By integrating socio-economic data and environmental factors such as sea-level rise and flood hazard risks, the model assesses how these variables influence insurance premiums across different demographics and geographic regions. The simulation highlights the equitable nature of the Risk 2.0 methodology, which considers the cost to rebuild and local flood risks, resulting in higher premiums for more expensive homes and those in high-risk areas. The model's findings align with local reports indicating increased premiums for many households in South Florida, thereby validating the model's accuracy and relevance.
