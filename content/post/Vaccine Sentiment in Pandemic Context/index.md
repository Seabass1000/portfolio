title: "An analysis of Vaccine sentiment on X during the Pandemic"
---
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the discourse around vaccines appeard to become highly polarized and significant on social media platforms. This project involved a sentiment and collocations analysis of approximately 9 million vaccine-related tweets in American English from March 2020 to November 2021. Utilizing the NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon, I conducted sentiment analysis to categorize tweets as positive, negative, or neutral and identified that the majority were neutral, with notable spikes in negative sentiment during periods with more infections. Additionally, the collocations analysis highlighted the interplay between political and informational content, suggesting that vaccine-related discourse was heavily influenced by political themes and efforts to spread awareness. This study offers insights into the dynamics of vaccine sentiment on social media and underscores the role of misinformation and political discourse in shaping public opinion during a global health crisis.
